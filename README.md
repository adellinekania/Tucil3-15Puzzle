## General Information

This program is a program that solves the 15 Puzzle problem by using the branch and bound algorithm. The program can read a puzzle from file input or generate a puzzle randomly and then determine whether the puzzle can be solved or not. 
<br/>If the puzzle can be completed, the program will display a sequence matrix of routes (paths) of actions performed from
starting position to the final arrangement based on the bound value or cost of each node
